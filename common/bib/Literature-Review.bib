  abstract   = {This work describes the adoption of a modified scrum framework (GenCyberScrum) for the NSA-NSF GenCyber program that focuses on delivering ten cybersecurity "first principles". The main objective of incorporating GenCyberScrum in the program was to empower students to self-manage by defining their own learning goals within the scope of several targeted educational outcomes. Forty high school students participated in the program by forming five groups of eight with equal numbers of male and female participants. Using the GenCyberScrum framework, each team successfully produced physical and virtual representations of all ten cybersecurity first principles through: 3D printing, 3D animations in Alice, Sketches/Gestures, Fuzzy Stick Models, and Sphero robotic light drawings.The NSA post-survey indicated that nearly three quarters of the participants (72.5\% or 29 out of 40) self-reported that they had never participated in any other cybersecurity activities before the program, but by the end, all 40 (100\%) agreed or strongly agreed that they could not only understand the ten cybersecurity principles, but they could actively perform security tests and apply fixes for a number of common vulnerabilities. The NSA experts' site visit evaluation also indicated that GenCyberScrum was highly effective in implementing all ten cybersecurity first principles. Overall, incorporating the GenCyberScrum framework in a school, summer camp, or workshop environment could help students take active ownership of learning objectives and improve the learning experience.},

  abstract  = {There is a global shortage of more than 1 million skilled cybersecurity professionals needed to address current cybersecurity challenges [5]. Criminal organizations, nation-state adversaries, hacktavists, and numerous other threat actors continuously target business, government, and even critical infrastructure networks. Estimated losses from cyber crime and cyber espionage amount to hundreds of billions annually [4]. The need to build, maintain, and defend computing resources is greater than ever before. A novel approach to closing the cybersecurity workforce gap is to develop cutting-edge cybersecurity video games that (1) grab the attention of young adults, (2) build a solid foundation of information security knowledge and skills, (3) inform players of potential career paths, and (4) establish a passion that drives them through higher education and professional growth. Although some video games and other games do exist, no viable options are available that target high-school-age students and young adults that supply both a quality gaming experience and foster the gain of key cybersecurity knowledge and skills. Given the Department of Defense's success with simulations and gaming technology, its sponsorship of a cybersecurity video game could prove extremely valuable in addressing the current and future needs for our next generation cyber warriors.},

  abstract  = {There has recently been a great deal of interest in the potential of computer games to function as innovative educational tools. However, there is very little evidence of games fulfilling that potential. Indeed, the process of merging the disparate goals of education and games design appears problematic, and there are currently no practical guidelines for how to do so in a coherent manner. In this paper, we describe the successful, empirically validated teaching methods developed by behavioural psychologists and point out how they are uniquely suited to take advantage of the benefits that games offer to education. We conclude by proposing some practical steps for designing educational games, based on the techniques of Applied Behaviour Analysis. It is intended that this paper can both focus educational games designers on the features of games that are genuinely useful for education, and also introduce a successful form of teaching that this audience may not yet be familiar with.},

  abstract  = { In this reply to commentaries on the Kirschner, Sweller, and Clark (2006) paper, we not only reemphasize the importance of randomized, controlled experimental tests of competing instructional procedures, but also indicate that altering one variable at a time is an essential feature of a properly controlled experiment. Furthermore, we also emphasize that variable must be relevant to the issue at hand with its effects explainable by our knowledge of human cognitive architecture. We reject the view that the presentation of relevant information should be reduced in favor of teaching learners how to find information. Lastly, we indicate that we believe a new educational psychology has been developed that has the potential to rapidly change our field. }

  abstract  = {Peer instruction pedagogy is a student-centric approach that encourages students to read lecture material before coming to class and engages them in class via group discussion and preplanned conceptual questions. Peer instruction has shown promising results in core computer science courses such as Theory of Computation and Computer Architecture, as well as reducing failure rates and improving student retention in computer science major. This paper presents the results of the first-ever attempt to replicate these results in a cybersecurity course, using an action research methodology to implement and evaluate peer instruction in a semester-long cybersecurity course, Introduction to Computer Security. The evaluation consists of quizzes, subjective exams, peer instruction questions, and attitudinal surveys gathered over two control semesters and one peer instruction condition semester. We find evidence of learning gains during group discussion and improvements in dropout and failure rates compared to traditional lecture classes. In attitudinal surveys, most students report that they would recommend that other instructors use peer instruction.},
