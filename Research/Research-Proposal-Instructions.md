# OVERVIEW

*[Link](https://honorspaths1.honors.umass.edu/chc-paths/honors_research_contracts/8088/edit?) to original website.*

The proposal, which is an essential component of the 499T/P Honors Research Contract, is intended to

 - define your Honors Thesis or Honors Portfolio
 - establish a precise list of goals, methods, evaluation procedures, and faculty expectations
 - serve as part of the 499T/499P binding agreement between you, your research committee, and Commonwealth Honors College
 - protect you and your research committee from misunderstandings that could cause graduation delays

As part of the 499T/P Honors Research Contract and Proposal Form, this proposal is a binding contract (similar to a course syllabus) that outlines expectations.
# INSTRUCTIONS
## 1. INTRODUCTION

What are you researching and why?

## 2. REVIEW OF LITERATURE

What have other researchers already written/published on your topic?

 - Demonstrate your understanding of the primary literature. (Seek guidance from your research committee chair) (about 5-15 pages)
 - Consult your research committee chair about the key literature needed for your Honors Thesis/Portfolio manuscript. Determine the formatting style used in your discipline for notes and bibliography (e.g., Chicago, MLA, APA, a specific journal, etc.). Be sure to note the style you will be using.

## 3. METHOD

How are you conducting your research?

 - What procedures or techniques are you using to gather information/data for your thesis?

 - Describe any specialized training you have received or will receive to conduct your research (e.g., lab safety certification or human/animal testing), and indicate who provided the training.

## 4. EVALUATION

How will your work be reviewed and graded?

 - What measurable goals does your research committee expect you to accomplish during the final stages of your research/creative project?
 - How will your committee provide feedback regarding your progress?
 - How will your committee assess the viability of your research to produce an Honors Thesis/Portfolio manuscript with oral defense?
 - If you are registering for an Honors Portfolio, be specific about the artifact that you will produce in addition to the manuscript (e.g., a novel, poetry collection, art DVD, case study, engineering design, story board, film DVD, or musical composition CD or DVD).

## 5. COMMUNICATION

What are the expectations about meetings with your committee chair and other committee member(s)? Be specific.

 - What time commitment (number of hours of work per week) is expected to be applied to your research between meetings with your committee chair?

## 6. TIMELINE

What are the dates and expectations for periodic review of your research results? (weekly? bi-weekly?)

 - What are the due dates for your manuscript:
    - Outline?
    - First draft?
    - Second draft?
    - Final, plus artifacts (if applicable)?
